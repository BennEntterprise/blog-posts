This is a folder of potential blog posts. Mostly they are mental exercises I use to get myself into the mindset of algorithmic thinking. Some will be very specific (with potential applications built), others will be more gedanken and "hand wavy".

Overall this is a theraputic way for me to decompress and just get my head away from any particular problem I might be facing, code or otherwise.
